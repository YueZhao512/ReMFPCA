Description: Methods and tools for implementing regularized multivariate functional principal component analysis (ReMFPCA) for multivariate functional data whose variables might be observed over different dimensional domains. ReMFPCA is an object-oriented (OO) interface leveraging the extensibility and scalability of R6. It employs a parameter vector to control the smoothness of each functional variable. By incorporating smoothness constraints as penalty terms within a regularized optimization framework, ReMFPCA generates smooth multivariate functional PCs, offering a concise and interpretable representation of the data.
